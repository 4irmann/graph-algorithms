# Graph Theory Algorithms
 
Some graph theory algorithms and visualizations implemented in Java.

## Installation

Download the binary algo.jar file from the releases. Make sure that Java JRE or JDK >= 1.7 is installed
In order to start the program, just double click the jar file in explorer (Windows).
If this doesn't work, try to start from the command line: `java -jar algo-x.x.x.jar`
E.g. on windows: press windows key+r, type cmd -> `java -jar path to algo-x.x.x.jar`

## Compilation

In order to compile your own executable jar file, just compile the Java code and 
add the resulting class files together with all source code files into a zip file.
Rename that zip file to jar. Done.
Hint: `.project` and `.classpath`files can be ignored. They are Eclipse IDE specific artifacts.
